## How to collect atomic assets

Collecting atomic assets is how you engage with the permaweb community and support creators. BazAR is the place to discover, collect, and showcase atomic assets. All data transacted on BazAR is stored permanently on Arweave, ensuring that valuable content is preserved for generations.

To start collecting atomic assets on BazAR, you first need to connect your wallet and create a BazAR profile. Once that’s done, you're ready to go.

#### Browse Collections and Single Atomic Assets

There are two ways to browse atomic assets on BazAR. From the homepage, you can explore the latest collections and the newest single atomic assets. Users can filter single atomic assets by listing prices, either “low to high” or “high to low.”

More advanced filtering and curation methods are under development and will be shared publicly soon.

#### Collecting on BazAR

From the asset page, you will find information regarding the asset, provenance details, asset rights, and listing price.

**Buy**

On the right side of the asset page, you will find the total asset balance and total balance for sale.

1. With the slider or form field, select how much you would like to purchase, whether it is a fractionalized asset or a 1-1 asset.
2. Click “Buy” and preview the transaction.
3. Confirm the transaction in your Arweave Wallet.

Shortly after purchasing the atomic asset, you will see the asset in your profile. Additionally, on the asset page, your profile will be shown under “currently owned by.”

**Provenance Details**

Since all atomic assets are stored on the Arweave network, the provenance details are retrievable and verifiable. In this section, you will find the following information:

- **Date Created**: Date the asset was uploaded to Arweave.
- **Block Height**: The block containing the transaction.
- **Transaction**: The transaction ID.
- **Implements**: Technical specifications of the transaction.

**Asset Rights**

Users can attach license tags to transactions called the Universal Data License (UDL). These tags specify how the piece of content can or cannot be used for commercial use, derivative works, and data model training. Learn more about UDL [here](#).
