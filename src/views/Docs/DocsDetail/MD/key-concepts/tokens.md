### Tokens

The Arweave ecosystem has many different tokens with various utilities. This guide will simplify the most important tokens used on BazAR.

#### AR Token

The AR token is the native currency of Arweave. AR is needed to engage with the Arweave network, whether for data storage or token transfers. Users pay a one-time fee for permanent data storage. Learn more about how Arweave data storage works [here](https://arwiki.wiki/#/en/storage-endowment).

#### How to buy AR tokens?

There are multiple methods to purchase AR. One of the easiest is to purchase in ArConnect directly via Transak. Additionally, AR is listed on the following centralized exchanges:

- [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/price/arweave)
- [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/price/arweave)
- [OKX](https://www.okx.com/)
- [Uphold](https://uphold.com/assets/crypto/buy-arweave)
- [Warzix](https://wazirx.com/exchange/AR-INR)

Alternatively, you can purchase AR through decentralized exchanges such as [everPay](https://everpay.io/). With everPay, you purchase the USDC token and then swap that for AR tokens.

#### Wrapped AR (wAR)

Wrapped AR is an Arweave token wrapped and cross-chained onto AO. wAR is the token used to make transactions on BazAR. wAR can be obtained by [bridging](https://aox.arweave.net/#/) AR or [swapping](https://wardepot.arweave.net/) ETH and USDC. Transfer Wrapped AR to other Arweave wallets on BazAR [here](https://ao-bazar.arweave.net/#/asset/xU9zFkq3X2ZQ6olwNVvr1vUWIjc3kXTWr7xKQD6dh10)

#### PIXL

PIXL is a rewards token for purchasing atomic assets on the Universal Content Marketplace. The longer the buying streak, the higher the daily PIXL rewards. PIXL is a fun reward designed to incentivize discovery and interaction with atomic assets, and does not necessarily have financial value.
