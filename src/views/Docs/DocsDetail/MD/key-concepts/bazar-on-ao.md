### BazAR on ao

The next chapter of BazAR is here. BazAR is now running on the ao hyper parallel computer. Learn more about BazAR on ao in this guide.

#### What is ao?

ao is a hyper parallel computing system built on the Arweave network, offering a unified environment for executing decentralized applications and smart contracts. Unlike traditional decentralized computer systems, ao provides an open message passing layer that connects parallel processes, creating a cohesive computing experience akin to websites linked through hyperlinks. This distributed architecture allows for computation without protocol-enforced limitations on size and form while ensuring network verifiability and trust minimization.

With ao, developers can launch command-line processes that function as smart contracts within the decentralized network. These processes operate without geographical constraints, promoting seamless user interactions across the network. ao thus establishes a shared, global computing platform where users can execute multiple processes securely and rely on services that consistently maintain their rights over time.

This environment fosters collaboration and innovation, enabling a new design space of applications that blend the benefits of smart contracts with those of traditional compute environments.

#### What is new with BazAR on ao

Horizontally scalable UCM. BazAR is a user-facing application on the Universal Content Marketplace (UCM) protocol. UCM provides a secure and transparent environment to trade assets without relying on third parties. Now that UCM is built within its own ao process, the protocol can horizontally scale across multiple processes, allowing for unbounded speed and efficiency.
Your BazAR profile is an ao process. Your digital assets sit in your ao profile process which is owned by your Arweave wallet. Your wallet address is the "owner" of the ao process, but the process itself holds the assets. This ao process is like a unique agent in aos, that acts based on your instructions and manages your assets securely.
Integration into the ao ecosystem. Since the launch of the ao testnet in February 2024, an ecosystem of technical and creative projects have emerged using ao. These range from social media platforms, metaverses, meme-coins and many more. BazAR on ao provides a platform to trade digital content with real-world rights.

#### Summary

BazAR, now built on ao, introduces a new paradigm to digital content marketplaces. Leveraging the ao hyper parallel computing system, BazAR establishes a trustless environment for trading digital assets on Arweave's permanent data layer. With BazAR on ao, transactions are executed by trustless smart contracts, enabling secure and transparent asset trading.

Additionally, BazAR profiles are now ao processes, providing enhanced security and flexibility in asset ownership. As BazAR integrates into the growing ao ecosystem, it opens up new possibilities for decentralized applications and creative projects. Get ready to explore the future of digital content with BazAR on ao.
