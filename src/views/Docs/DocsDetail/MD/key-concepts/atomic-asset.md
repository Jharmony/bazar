## Atomic assets

Atomic Assets are unique digital items stored on the permaweb, designed to simplify the ownership and transfer of digital assets while ensuring security and permanence. Unlike traditional NFTs, the data of an atomic asset—its metadata and smart contract—are uploaded together in a single, inseparable transaction. This eliminates reliance on external components, unlike other blockchains where these elements are often stored separately and linked by the smart contract.

Atomic Assets can represent anything from art, music, and videos to applications, domain names, or memberships. Read the full atomic asset specification [here](https://github.com/permaweb/permaweb-libs/blob/main/specs/spec-atomic-assets.md).

#### Atomic asset collections

Atomic asset collections are groups of atomic assets bundled together and displayed as a collection on the UCM. These collections can consist of existing atomic assets owned by the user, newly uploaded assets, or a combination of both. Read the atomic asset collection specification [here](https://github.com/permaweb/permaweb-libs/blob/main/specs/spec-collections.md).
