## BazAR Learn

Welcome to the permaweb's fully decentralized atomic asset exchange. BazAR empowers creators and collectors to interact, trade, and transact with any form of digital content, from images and music to videos, papers, components, and even applications. In these guides, you can learn more about how to use BazAR and why this platform is more than just an NFT marketplace.

#### Core functionality

BazAR is built on top of the Universal Content Marketplace (UCM) protocol, a trustless order-book for trading atomic assets on Arweave.

- **Powered by AO**: The UCM now runs on [AO](https://ao.arweave.net/). AO is a hyper parallel computing system built on the Arweave network, offering a unified environment for executing decentralized applications and smart contracts. All transactions on BazAR are carried out through AO smart contracts.

- **Trustless transactions**: Users no longer have to rely on third-party intermediaries to make transactions. BazAR serves as a user interface for the UCM. Over time, we expect more UIs to emerge that support unique experiences for creators and collectors.

- **Licensable data**: The [Universal Data License](https://udlicense.arweave.net/) (UDL) ensures that value flows equitably to those who create and contribute to the permaweb. This standard framework allows creators to set their own terms for the usage of content they upload to the permaweb. Learn more about UDL [here](#).

- **Earn $PIXL rewards**: Built into the UCM protocol is a rewards token that is awarded when users maintain a buying streak. The longer the buying streak, the larger the daily $PIXL rewards! Learn more about $PIXL [here](https://ao-bazar.arweave.net/#/docs/collectors/earn-pixl).
