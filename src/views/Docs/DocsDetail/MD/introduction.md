# Bazar Learn

Welcome to the first fully decentralized atomic asset exchange built on the permaweb. Through the power of the Universal Content Marketplace (UCM) protocol and the Universal Data License (UDL) content creators can trade digital assets with real world rights. BazAR empowers creators and users alike to interact, trade, and transact with any form of digital content, from images and music to videos, papers, components, and even applications.

In this "early" release, BazAR showcases new possibilities for how to bring value to onchain data on Arweave. Considered an early "beta" release, BazAR continues to evolve, following an iterative development process aimed at establishing the first fully onchain marketplace on the permaweb.
