# BazAR Learn

Welcome to the first fully decentralized atomic asset exchange built on the permaweb. Through the power of the Universal Content Marketplace (UCM) protocol and the Universal Data License ([UDL](https://udlicense.arweave.dev/)) content creators can trade digital assets with real world rights. BazAR empowers creators and users alike to interact, trade, and transact with any form of digital content, from images and music to videos, papers, components, and even applications.

In this "early" release, BazAR showcases the possibilities for transacting digital content on Arweave. Learn more about BazAR and the permaweb in these info pages.
