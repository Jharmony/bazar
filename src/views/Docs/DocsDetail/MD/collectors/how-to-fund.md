### How to fund your account

To engage in transactions on BazAR, you need Wrapped AR (wAR). You can obtain wAR by either bridging AR onto AO or swapping other AO tokens for wAR. Here’s how to do it:

#### 1. Create a BazAR profile process

Before you can send tokens to BazAR, ensure you have a BazAR profile process. If you don’t have one, you can create it [here](#).

#### 2. Bridge AR onto AO (AR → wAR)

If you hold AR, you can bridge it onto AO using [AOX](https://aox.arweave.dev/#/).

Follow these steps:

1. Bridge your AR onto AO, converting it to wAR.
2. After bridging, you will be prompted to send your wAR to your BazAR profile process.
3. Confirm the transaction.
4. Your wAR balance will now appear in the profile sidebar.

#### 3. Swap AO tokens for wAR

You can swap AO tokens such as CRED, TRUNK, and others for wAR on [ArSwap](https://arswap.org/swap). Here’s how:

1. Swap your AO tokens for wAR.
2. After swapping, you will be prompted to send your wAR to your BazAR profile process.
3. Confirm the transaction.
4. Your wAR balance will now appear in the profile sidebar.

#### 4. How to purchase $AR

You can buy $AR directly in your [ArConnect](https://www.arconnect.io/) wallet, on cryptocurrency exchanges, or swap it with other cryptocurrencies using [Permaswap](https://app.permaswap.network/). Here are some popular exchanges to buy AR:

- [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/price/arweave)
- [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/price/arweave)
- [OKX](https://www.okx.com/)
- [Uphold](https://uphold.com/assets/crypto/buy-arweave)
- [WazirX](https://wazirx.com/exchange/AR-INR)

Once you purchase $AR, send it to your Arweave wallet, and then bridge it onto ao to obtain wAR.
