## Renderers explained

If you come from the wider crypto ecosystem, then you probably have heard of Farcaster Frames, a canvas for developers to create widgets that are embedded in the Farcaster protocol. Frames were a hit in the crypto community as this showed composability, improvements to web3 ux, and opened the door for developers to experiment.

The permaweb has had this feature for almost a year prior to Frames in what we call Renderers. The ANS-108: Render-With metadata tag allows for creators to upload data onto Arweave that is rendered/experienced in the way it was meant to be viewed.

If you come from the web2 community, think of Renderers as essentially iFrames that any permaweb application can incorporate.
