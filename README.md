# BazAR Built on AO/UCM

Welcome to BazAR, the first fully decentralized atomic asset exchange built on the permaweb. BazAR leverages the power of the [Universal Content Marketplace (UCM)](https://ucm-wiki.g8way.io/#/en/main) protocol, [ao](https://github.com/permaweb/ao) and the [Universal Data License](https://udlicense.arweave.dev/ (UDL)) to enable content creators to trade digital assets with real-world rights. Here's everything you need to know to get started with BazAR:

## What is the UCM?
BazAR is a digital content marketplace that operates on the Universal Content Marketplace (UCM) protocol. UCM is a protocol built on the permaweb, facilitating trustless exchange of atomic assets. UCM also ensures data permanence on Arweave, safeguarding valuable content from loss. It empowers creators and users alike to interact, trade, and transact with various forms of digital content, ranging from images and music to videos, papers, components, and applications.

With the UCM, creators retain control over their assets, fostering a decentralized ecosystem where ownership is protected, and interactions are trustless.

## What is AO and how is it used on the UCM?

AO is a hyper-parallel computing system built on the Arweave network, offering a unified environment for executing decentralized applications and smart contracts. Unlike traditional decentralized computer systems, AO provides an open message passing layer that connects parallel processes, creating a cohesive computing experience akin to websites linked through hyperlinks.

AO enables computation without protocol-enforced limitations on size and form while ensuring network verifiability and trust minimization. Developers can launch command-line processes, called aos, as smart contracts within the decentralized network. These processes operate without geographical constraints, promoting seamless user interactions across the network.

Transactions on BazAR are fulfilled by trustless smart contracts built on AO. BazAR is one of the first user-facing applications to utilize AO smart contracts, providing a secure and efficient trading environment. For more information about AO, refer to the documentation specs [here](https://ao.arweave.dev/#/) and project repo [here](https://github.com/permaweb/ao).
