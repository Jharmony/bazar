# BazAR Marketplace 

Welcome to BazAR, the first fully decentralized atomic asset exchange built on the permaweb. BazAR leverages the power of the [Universal Content Marketplace (UCM)](https://github.com/permaweb/ao-ucm) protocol, [ao](https://github.com/permaweb/ao) and the [Universal Data License](https://udlicense.arweave.dev/ (UDL)) to enable content creators to trade digital assets with real-world rights.

## UCM Overview
The Universal Content Marketplace (UCM) is a protocol built on the permaweb designed to enable trustless exchange of atomic assets. It empowers creators and users to interact, trade, and transact with any form of digital content, from images and music to videos, papers, components, and even applications. BazAR is the first user interface that operates on the Universal Content Marketplace (UCM) protocol. 


## AO Overview

AO is a hyper-parallel computing system built on the Arweave network, offering a unified environment for executing decentralized applications and smart contracts. Unlike traditional decentralized computer systems, AO provides an open message passing layer that connects parallel processes, creating a cohesive computing experience akin to websites linked through hyperlinks.

AO enables computation without protocol-enforced limitations on size and form while ensuring network verifiability and trust minimization. Developers can launch command-line processes, called aos, as smart contracts within the decentralized network. These processes operate without geographical constraints, promoting seamless user interactions across the network.

Transactions on BazAR (UCM)  are fulfilled by trustless smart contracts built on ao. BazAR is one of the first user-facing applications to utilize ao smart contracts, providing a secure and efficient trading environment. For more information about ao, refer to the documentation specs [here](https://ao.arweave.dev/#/) and project repo [here](https://github.com/permaweb/ao).
